<p>And we’re a community that wants to help you succeed in the JavaScript world. WeAllJS is a Slack, Twitter account, and its adjacent meetups and groups that’s committed to being supportive, attentive, and <em>inclusive</em>.</p>

<p>WeAllJS is also an experiment: We strongly believe that the tech industry as a whole can do a lot better to welcome people, and that we all benefit when everyone can come to the table. The community is organized by individuals of various backgrounds experienced in both technical topics and in community building and social issues. It is a project filled with hope and love.</p>

<p>The community welcomes anyone, on any intersection, who feels JavaScript is a part of their professional lives and wants to have access to others – anyone from students to experts to Ruby/Rails developers doing frontend or using JS tools, or sysadmins looking to deploy it. Or just those who are interested.</p>
