# RFC [r] - WeAllJS RFC Process 

[ratified 2016-09-03]
{: .text-italic}

WeAllJS was originally created as an experiment in building inclusive, open, and valuable community. As such, its founders and members greatly value documenting the various processes that go into making the community effective in its mission. This documentation, as a whole, is meant to be a sort of "product" that the community can offer, for free, to other communities and organizations, such that they can learn from both the successes and failures that we have worked through.

This policy documentation, and the discussion and review process that goes into drafting, reviewing, and finalizing it, is called the WeAllJS RFC Process.

## What's an RFC?

The name itself is a reference to the IETF's Request For Comments process, and basically involves a document or series of documents which are drafted, reviewed, and eventually ratified (approved) by the WeAllJS community through discussion among those interested.

An RFC can extend, modify, or alter any part of the WeAllJS community policy, whether or not it's been documented. This includes the Code of Conduct, the Enforcement process, the Channel policy, and anything else that affects a significant part of the community. It can also propose entirely new policies and community agreements.

## How do I create an RFC?

Easy: Just join the #meta channel and create a new Slack Post by clicking on the + next to the message box. Prefix whatever title you're using for your RFC with RFC -, and then share it with #meta once you've drafted the initial document.

There's currently no set structure to what these documents should look like, but generally an initial introductory section followed by a series of headers is a pretty good way to write readable documentation.

If you're unsure if the RFC topic is relevant or appropriate, feel free to ask in #meta, gauge interest, or even use /admin to talk to an administrator about what you're thinking of proposing.

## How does review work?

All comments on a particular RFC should be done directly on the document: Slack posts have a small speech bubble on the top right of the document window that can be used to add new comments to the document. This helps preserve any conversation that happened, save questions, etc, which will be protected from the Slack's 10k message limit. As much discussion as possible should be handled in the general context of #meta or private messages, or even private channels, but the final document must be available and visible to all members, and be shared in #meta.

## How do RFCs get ratified?

Once an RFC has had "some discussion" around it (which is a fairly fuzzy metric), and a general consensus has been reached, it will be put up for ratification in #meta. By default, the RFC will be considered "ratified" 24 hours after an announcement about it being up for ratification has been posted in #meta, and the RFC will be considered official WeAllJS policy.

If it's specifically requested for a legitimate reason, or if admins determine that the topic of the RFC demands extra attention and care because of its potential impact, an RFC's "ratification period" may be extended for as long as the participants and admins feel is a reasonable length of time for consideration.

## What happens after ratification?

Once an RFC is ratified, it is considered Official WeAllJS Community Policy, and will be marked as ratified in the topic. At some point, the policy described in the RFC will be moved to an appropriate location on the public WeAllJS site, where others can refer to it, and the Slack Post will be unpinned.

## How do I change an RFC after ratification?

RFCs themselves cannot be modified after ratification, but new RFCs can be proposed and ratified to amend or remove a policy previously ratified through the RFC process. These amendments will involve the exact same process as a regular RFC.
