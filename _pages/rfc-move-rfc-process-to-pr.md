# RFC - Use Github PRs for RFC Review

Slack posts are nice for some types of documents, but for things that need an actual review process, Github's Pull Request feature is a much better fit.

As such, this RFC proposes that the process be moved to Github.

## Proposed changes

* Change any mention of Slack posts for review use in https://wealljs.org/rfc-process to refer to Github PRs instead.
* Specify that at least one WeAllJS admin should be marked as a reviewer for the PR, along with any other users who would like to be included in its review.
* Remove all pinned RFC documents from `#meta` (since they're on the site now)
