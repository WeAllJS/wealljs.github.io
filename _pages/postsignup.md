# Yay! You've signed up!

Admins will send an invite soon! Check our [signup
policy](http://wealljs.org/rfc-signup) for more info.

In the meantime, here's some stuff to keep handy:

* [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct.html)
* [Culture and Process](/culture-and-process.html) notes about how the WeAllJS handles regular community stuff, how itâ€™s organized, and all that.
* The list of [private ("identity") channels](https://slack-files.com/T1WSA6TGQ-F27V6KM1C-5335c58dd0). You can request an invite to any of these using the `/join-private #channelname` command once you're logged in.
* The list of [public ("resource") channels](https://slack-files.com/T1WSA6TGQ-F27V51W22-821023e17a).
* If you want to see all available-to-join channels once you're in the slack, you can use the `/list-private` command.
* If you need to get in touch with an admin, use the `/admin message-goes-here` command!

See you soon!
