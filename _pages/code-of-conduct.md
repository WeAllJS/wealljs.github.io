# WeAllJS Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members of
the WeAllJS community pledge to making participation in our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
technical preferences, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances, including when simulated online. The only exception to sexual topics
  is channels/spaces specifically for topics of sexual identity.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of "outing" of
  of any aspect of someone's identity without their consent.
* Publishing screenshots or quotes, especially from identity channels, without all quoted users' *explicit* consent.
* Publishing or telling others that a member belongs to a particular identity channel without asking their consent first.
* Publishing of non-harassing private communication.
* Any of the above even when [presented as "ironic" or "joking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism).
* Any attempt to present "reverse-ism" versions of the above as violations. Examples of reverse-isms are "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", "heterophobia", and "cisphobia".
* Unsolicited explanations under the assumption that someone doesn't already know it. Ask before you teach! Don't assume what people's knowledge gaps are.
* [Feigning or exaggerating surprise](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-feigned-surprise) when someone admits to not knowing something.
* "[Well-actuallies](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-well-actuallys)"
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional or community setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Community admins are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Admins have the right and responsibility to remove any messages, channels,
images, or other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct,
or to ban temporarily or permanently any member or participant for other
behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
Members expelled from events or venues with any sort of paid attendance will not
be refunded.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in other spaces
involving the community. This includes the WeAllJS Slack, its Twitter community,
private email communications in the context of the community, and any events
where members of the community are participating, as well as adjacent
communities and venues affecting the community's members.

Depending on the violation, the admins may decide that violations of this code
of conduct that have happened outside of the scope of the community may deem an
individual unwelcome, and take appropriate action to maintain the comfort and
safety of its members.

## Enforcement

**The Admin team will prioritize the well-being and comfort of the recipients of
the violation over the comfort of the violator.**

The detailed enforcement procedure for any violation of the WeAllJS community
standards can be found at the [Enforcement Procedures](/enforcement) page.

[tl;dr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL%3BDR): Mention the issue to the person
involved, if possible, and if needed, use one of the following methods to
contact the admin staff when you believe a violation has occurred:

* Use the `/admin` command in the WeAllJS Slack to send a message directly to the admin channel.
* Direct Message [@WeAllJS](https://twitter.com/wealljs) on Twitter with the details and any relevant links.
* Email the admins directly at [coc@wealljs.org](mailto:coc@wealljs.org)
* Directly message any admin in private (through either Twitter, Slack, or email, as available) if it is a preferred or more comfortable avenue.

Please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or
other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the
situation.

The admin team will do its best to address the issue in a timely manner and
follow the [enforcement procedure](/enforcement). They will, within reason,
keep you up to date on progress and do their best to respect reasonable boundaries.

Admins and other leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in
good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the community's leadership.
