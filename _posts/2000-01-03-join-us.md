Everyone is welcome!

Please note that WeAllJS strives to be a **supportive community** and expects an
appropriate level of respect and mutual understanding. We have a strong [Code of
Conduct](#todo) and [enforcement policy](#todo). tl;dr: We do not welcome
discrimination, harassment, or any other form of harm against our members, and
we prioritize the well-being of those who are hurt over the comfort of those who
caused harm. Check out our [Culture and Process](/culture-and-process.html)
document for other details about how the community is structured, how channels
are managed, and more!

If you're cool with all that? We'd love to have you! Filling out this form will submit a signup request to the WeAllJS Slack. You should receive an email shortly after.
