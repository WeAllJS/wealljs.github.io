Everyone is welcome!

Please note that WeAllJS strives to be a **supportive community** and expects an
appropriate level of respect and mutual understanding. We have a strong [Code
of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). We do not welcome discrimination, harassment, or
any other form of harm against our members, and we **prioritize the well-being
of those who are hurt over the comfort of those who caused harm**. Check out our
[Culture and Process](/culture-and-process) document for other details about how
the community is structured, how channels are managed, and more!
