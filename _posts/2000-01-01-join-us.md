### Join the Slack!
{: .text-center}

Everyone is welcome!

Please note that WeAllJS strives to be a **supportive community** and expects an
appropriate level of respect and mutual understanding. We have a strong [Code
of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) and an associated [Enforcement
Policy](/enforcement). tl;dr: We do not welcome discrimination, harassment, or
any other form of harm against our members, and we **prioritize the well-being
of those who are hurt over the comfort of those who caused harm**. Check out our
[Culture and Process](/culture-and-process) document for other details about how
the community is structured, how channels are managed, and more!

If you're cool with all that? We'd love to have you! Filling out this form will
submit a signup request to the WeAllJS Slack. You should receive an email
shortly after.
